 Movie Recommender System
The project implements a movie recommender system that recommends movies based on user-input emotions. The system uses IMDb data to fetch movie information and provides a user-friendly interface developed with Flask. Users can input emotions, set filters such as minimum year, maximum year, and minimum rating, and receive movie recommendations accordingly. The recommendations are displayed through interactive scatter plots and bar charts. Additionally, there is an option to include a user's rating for personalized recommendations.

Key Components:

Frontend: Implemented using HTML with Flask for user interaction.
Backend: Utilizes IMDb data for movie information and incorporates filters for enhanced user experience.
Interactive Plots: Scatter plots and bar charts are generated using Plotly Express to visualize movie data.
Recommendations: Provides a list of recommended movies based on user-input emotions and filters.
